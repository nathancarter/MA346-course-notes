(What an observation is depends on what you've gathered data about.  In the first table above, an observation seems to be the amount of sales by a particular person on a particular day.)  His rationale comes from people who've studied databases, and if you've taken CS350 at Bentley, you may be familiar with the related concept of database normal forms.  The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of R packages that help you work smoothly with data if you organize it in tidy form.\n",

    "We can state precisely what `df.pivot()` does by building on what we've learned in previous chapters.  We can describe both the *requirements* and *guarantees* of the pivot function, and can do so in terms of functions and relations.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Requirements of `df.pivot()`:\n",
    "    * The table to be pivoted must express a *function* from at least two input columns (called `index` and `columns`, above) to one output column (called `values`, above).\n",
    "    * It is acceptable for the `index` to comprise more than one column, as in the example above.\n",
    "    * Recall that for it to be a function, inputs cannot be repeated, because that could connect them with more than one output.\n",
    " * Guarantees of `df.pivot()`:\n",

    "    * A new column will be created for each unique value in the old `columns` column.\n",
    "    * The `values` column will have been removed.\n",
    "    * For each `index` entry $i$ in the original DataFrame and each `columns` entry $c$, if $v$ is the unique value associated with it, then the new table will contain a row with `index` $i$ and with $v$ in the column entitled $c$.\n",
    "\n",

    "       * Inputs: first name, last name, day\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall that pivoting just turns \"tall\" data into \"wide\" data.  And tall form is how you typically store data when doing an analysis, because of the ease of processing tall data using code, while wide form is often more attractive for a human reading data from a table.  **So the purpose of pivoting is typically when you're generating reports for human consumption.**"

    "The reverse operation to a pivot is called \"melt.\"  This comes from the fact that wide data \"falls down\" (like the drips of a melting icicle perhaps?) into tall form, which you can watch happen in the animation below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The genreal idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as pivoting was usually to turn data stored for computers into data readable by humans, melting is for the reverse.  If you're given data in wide form, but you want to prepare it for analysis, you often want to convert it into tall form to make subsequent data processing code easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we were given the table below of students' performance on various exams.  (Obviously, this is fake data.)  If we would rather view each exam as a separate observation, so that each row is a single exam score, we can melt the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drag the slider to see the melting in action.  While you do so, watch the following parts of the table:\n",
    " 1. The gray cells:\n",
    "     * Because we'll be spreading a student's data out over more than one row, these will be copied.\n",
    "     * These function as unique IDs for each row, so pandas calls these columns the `id_vars`.\n",
    " 2. The red cells:\n",
    "     * These are the titles for each of several different functions.\n",
    "     * Each function takes a student as input and gives a type of exam score as output.\n",
    "     * They will change from being column headers to being values in the table, so pandas calls them the `value_vars`.\n",
    " 3. The other colors:\n",
    "     * Each other color represents a separate function (blue maps students to SAT score, green maps students to ACT score, and yellow maps students to GPA).\n",
    "     * Because we're collecting all scores into a single column, these will stack up to become just one column.\n",

    "## Pivot tables\n",
    "\n",
    "All this talk of pivoting should remind you of the very common Excel operation called \"pivot table.\"  It is very much like the pivot operation, with two differences.  First, it doesn't require the table to represent a function.  Second, it does require you to explain how values will be summarized or combined.  Naturally, pandas suppoorts this operation as well, and it's extremely useful.\n",

    "If `df.pivot()` makes a tall table wide, then `df.pivot_table()` makes a tall table sort of wide.  We'll see why below.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the table shown below, notice that mapping from the gray columns to the blue column is *not* a function.  If it were, we could pivot on the blue column, and the green cells would rearrange themselves just as they did in the first animation up above.  But try dragging the slider below *slowly* and you will see that some green cells collide.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, Amy Smith has two different sales to the same customer, Facebook, and Bob Jones has two different sales to the same customer, Amazon.  So we cannot simply create a Facebook column and an Amazon column and rearrange the sales data into them.  When two sales figures need to be placed under the same customer heading, we need some way to combine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the table below combines cells is by adding, which is a very sensible thing to do with sales data for a customer.  You can see that the code asks this by specifying the aggregation function (or `aggfunc`) to be \"sum.\"\n",

    "This is why a `pivot_table` operation doesn't make a table that's as wide as a `pivot` might, because some cells are combined, meaning that the overall table reduces in size.\n",
