Data scientist and R developer Hadley Wickham wrote a paper called [Tidy Data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf), which he defines as data with exactly one \"observation\" per row.  (What an observation is depends on what you've gathered data about.  In the first table above, an observation seems to be the amount of sales by a particular person on a particular day.)  His rationale comes from people who've studied databases, and if you've taken CS350 at Bentley, you may be familiar with the related concept of database normal forms.

    "## Pivot tables\n",
    "\n",
    "All this talk of pivoting should remind you of the very common tool in Microsoft Excel (and many other applications, such as Tableau) called \"pivot table.\"  It is very much like the pivot operation, with two differences.  First, it doesn't require the table to represent a function.  Second, it does require you to explain how values will be summarized or combined.  Naturally, pandas supports this operation as well, and it's extremely useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `df.pivot()` makes a tall table wide, then `df.pivot_table()` makes a tall table sort of wide.  We'll see why below.\n",

    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "In the table shown below, notice that if we try to consider the gray and blue columns as inputs and the green column as outputs, the relationship is *not* a function.  If it were, we could pivot on the blue column, and the green cells would rearrange themselves just as they did in the first animation (in [the Pivot section](#pivot)).  But try dragging the slider below *slowly* and you will see that some green cells collide.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, Amy Smith has two different sales to the same customer, Facebook, and Bob Jones has two different sales to the same customer, Amazon.  So we cannot simply create a Facebook column and an Amazon column and rearrange the sales data into them.  When two sales figures need to be placed under the same customer heading, we need some way to combine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the table below combines cells is by adding, which is a very sensible thing to do with sales data for a customer.  You can see that the code asks this by specifying the aggregation function (or `aggfunc`) to be \"sum.\"  But there are many aggregation functions, because \"sum\" is not always what you want; perhaps you wanted a report of average sales, or maximum sales, or something else.  [The DataCamp content](big-cheat-sheet.html#manipulating-dataframes-with-pandas) you did in preparation for today covered other aggregation functions.\n",

    "### Animation for unstack/stack at level 0\n",
    "\n",
    "The level of a stack/unstack operation refers to which level of the multi-index will be moved.  The animation below shows `df.unstack( level=0 )` when you move the slider from left to right, so level 0 of the row multi-index (the months) moves up to become part of the column index.  It is always placed as an inner index, but this can be changed afterwards with `df.swaplevel()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse operation is therefore actually a combination of `df.stack()` (which would put the months inside the weeks) and `df.swaplevel()` (which would fix that) all in one.\n",
    "\n",
    "(This animation can be viewed [in its own page here](https://nathancarter.github.io/dataframe-animations/stack-0.html).)"
