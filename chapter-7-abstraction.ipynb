    "\n",
    "Abstract and concrete are at opposite ends of a spectrum; concrete refers to specific things, usually with more details in them, and abstract refers to general principles or ideas, usually unconnected to any specific example.  The following table may help clarify this.\n",

    "|       | Concrete (or specific) | Abstract (or general) |\n",
    "|-------|----------------------|------------------------|\n",
    "| Example from science: | When we drop things, they fall to earth. | Gravitation obeys the principle $G_{\\mu v}+\\Lambda g_{\\mu v}=\\frac{8\\pi G}{c^4}T_{\\mu v}$ |\n",
    "| Example from business: | That startup failed because each partner tried to pull it in a different direction. | Organizations need everyone to pursue a single, clear vision. |\n",

    "*Abstraction* is therefore the process of moving from the concrete toward the abstract, or from the specific to the general.  Therefore it's also called *generalization.*  Humans are pretty good at learning general principles from specific examples, so this is a natural thing for us to do.\n",

    "Both of these mathematical examples involved replacing numbers with variables.  In Example 1, the coefficients in the specific example $16x^2-9x+5=0$ turned into $a$, $b$, and $c$ in $ax^2+bx+c=0$.  In Example 2, you didn't write formulas that had specific scores in them (as you would have if computing the scores by hand), but wrote formulas that contained Excel-style variables, which have names like A5 and B14, that come from the relevant cells.  In math (and in programming as well), abstraction typically involves *replacing specific constants with variables.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've rephrased our computation in terms of variables, we can do many different mathematical operations with it.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. We can think of our computation as a function.\n",
    "     * In Example 1, the quadratic formula can be seen as a function that takes as input the values $a,b,c$ and yields as output the two solutions of the equation.\n",
    "     * In Example 2, the Excel formulas can be seen as a function that take the assignment grades as input and yield the course grade as output.\n",
    " 2. We can ask what happens when one of the variables changes, a question that calculus focuses on.\n",
    "     * For instance, you could ask what happens to your computation as one of the variables gets larger and larger.  (In calculus, we wrote this as $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}$.)\n",
    "     * Or you could ask how quickly the result of the computation responds to changes in one input variable.  (In calculus, we wrote this as $\\frac{d}{dx}$.)\n",
    " 3. We can make statements about the computation in terms of the input variables.\n",
    "     * In Example 1, we might say that \"Every quadratic equation has two complex number solutions.\"\n",
    "     * In Example 2, we might say that \"It's still possible for me to get an A- in this course if my final exam score is good enough.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The statement you just read about every quadratic equation is a *universal* statement, also called a \"for all\" statement.  You could rephrase it as:  For all inputs $a,b,c$, the outputs of the quadratic formula are two complex numbers.  The statement from Example 2 is an *existence* statement, also called a \"for some\" statement.  You could rephrase it as:  For some final exam scores, my final course grade is still a 4.0.  For all/for some statements are central to mathematics and we will see them show up a lot.  \"For all\" and \"for some\" are called *quantifiers* and are sometimes written $\\forall$ (for all) and $\\exists$ (for some, or \"there exists\")."

    "Best practices for coding include writing DRY code, where DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself.  If you find yourself writing the same code (or extremely similar code) more than once, especially if you're copying and pasting, this is a sure sign that you are not writing DRY code and should try to correct this style error.

Let's imagine that they wanted to keep just the first 8 columns and give them clearly readable names.  The code might look like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df_cases.drop( columns=df_cases.columns[8:], inplace=True )\n",
    "df_cases.columns = [ 'State, 'Country', 'Latitude', 'Longitude',\n",
    "                     'January', 'February', 'March', 'April' ]\n",

    "```\n",

    "The typical way of creating code like what's shown above is to write just the code for `df_cases`, run it, verifiy that it works, and then copy and paste it twice and change the details to apply the same code to the other two DataFrames.  But this code can be made much cleaner through abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than copy and paste the code and change key parts of it, replace those key parts with a *general* (that is, abstract) variable name, and then turn the code into a function.  Since this code drops the columns we don't care about, we could have made that the name of the function.\n",

    "drop_unneeded_columns( df_deaths )\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several advantages to this new version.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. While it is still six lines of code, half of them are much shorter, so there's less to read and understand.\n",
    " 2. What the code is doing is more obvious, because we've given it a name; we're obviously dropping columns we don't need.\n",
    " 3. It wasn't immediately obvious in the first version of the code that we were repeating the same procedure three times.  Now it is.\n",
    " 4. If you later need to change which columns you keep or how you name them, you have to make that change in only one place (inside the function).  Before, you would have had to make the same change three times.\n",
    " 5. Also, if you tried to make a change to the code later, but accidentally forgot to change one of the three copies, you'd have broken your code and maybe not realized it.\n",
    " 6. You could share this same function to other notebooks or with other coders if needed.\n",

It's useful in DataFrames imported from a file where dollar amounts were written in a form like $4,320,000.00, which pandas won't recognize as a number, because of the commas and the dollar sign.  This code converts such a column to numeric.  Since it's so useful, we may want to use it on multiple columns.\n",

Also, we've converted this column to type `float`, but perhaps some other column of money might better be represented as `int`, so we'll want the data type to be customizable also.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2:  Move each of the customizable pieces of code out into a variable with a helpful name, declared before the code is run.\n",
