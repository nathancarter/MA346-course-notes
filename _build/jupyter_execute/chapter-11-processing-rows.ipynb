    "Most introductory programming courses teach loops, and for good reason; they show up a lot in programming!  But there are a few reasons we'll try to avoid loops in data work whenever we can.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lesser reason is **readability.**  Loops are always at least two lines of code in Python; the one above is three because it has to initialize the `total` variable to zero.  Many alternatives to loops can be done in just one line of code, which is more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more important reason is **speed.**  Loops in Python are not very efficient, and this can be a serious problem.  In the final project for MA346 in Spring 2020, many students came to my office hours with a loop that had been running for hours, and they didn't know if or when it would finish.  There are *many* ways to speed loops up, sometimes by just altering the loop, but usually by replacing the loop with something else entirely.\n",

    "An added benefit is that improving (or replacing) loops with something faster often means writing shorter or clearer code as well, achieving improvements in readability at the same time."

    " * The function for this is often called `map()` or `apply()`, as in pandas, but not always.\n",

Its output type will determine what kind of output you get.  For example, the `get_first_year()` function defined above takes strings as input and gives integers as output.  So using `apply(get_first_year)` will need to be done on a Series containing strings, and will produce a Series containing integers.\n",

Or you can use the `args` or `kwargs` feature of `apply()`, but we won't cover that in these course notes.  You can see a small example in [the pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.apply.html).  We will, however, take a look at the possibility of using a dictionary with `map()`, because it is extremely useful.

    "I mentioned earlier that converting a loop into an `apply()` or `map()` call doesn't gain us much speed.  But it does make it easy for us to add a nice speed improvement.  There's a Python package called [swifter](https://github.com/jmcarpenter2/swifter) that you can install using the instructions on that page.  Once it's installed, you can convert any code like `df['column'].apply(f)` easily into a faster version by replacing it with `df['column'].swifter.apply(f)`.  That's all!\n",

    "Under the hood, swifter is trying a variety of speedup mechanisms (many of which we discuss in this chapter) and deciding which of them works best for your situation.  The most common one for large dataset is probably parallel processing.  This means that if your computer has more than one processor core (which most modern laptops do), then it can process more than one entry of the data at once, each on a separate core.\n",

    "## More on math in Python\n",

    "### Arithmetic in formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that pandas is built on NumPy, and in [Chapter 9 of the notes](chapter-9-math-and-stats) we talked about NumPy's support for vectorization.  If we have a Series `height` containing heights in inches and we need instead to have it in centimeters, we don't need to do `height.apply()` and give it a conversion function, because we can just do `height * 2.54`.  NumPy automatically *vectorizes* this operation, spreading the \"times 2.54\" over each entry in the `height` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite natural, because we have mathematical notation that does the same thing (in math, not Python).  If you've taken a class involving vectors, you know that vector addition $\\vec x+\\vec y$ means to do exactly what NumPy does--add the corresponding entries in each vector.  Similarly, scalar multiplication $s\\vec x$ means to multiply $s$ by each entry in the vector $\\vec x$, just like `height * 2.54` does in Python.  So NumPy is not inventing something strange here; it's normal mathematical stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the basic mathematical operations are built into NumPy.  For example, if we have created a linear model $\\hat y=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 x$ with parameters stored in Python variables `β0` and `β1`, we can apply it to an entire series of inputs `xs` at once with the following code, because NumPy knows how to spread both `+` and `*` across arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y_hat = β0 + β1 * xs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, if we had actual `ys` that went with the `xs`, we could then compute a list of residuals all at once with `y_hat - ys`, or even compute the RMSE (root mean squared error) with code like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "np.sqrt( np.sum( ( y_hat - ys ) ** 2 ) / len( ys ) )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The subtraction with `-` and the squaring with `** 2` would all be spread across arrays of inputs correctly, because NumPy comes with code to support doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditionals with `np.where()`\n",
    "\n",
    "This removes a lot of the need for both loops and `apply()`/`map()` calls, but not all.  One of the first things that makes us think we might need a loop is when a conditional computation needs to be done.  For instance, let's say we were given a dataset like the following (made up) example."

Let's say you were looking for an example of a Hispanic male in Nevada applying for a mortgage for a rental property.  If you ask pandas to filter the dataset, it will examine all 15M rows and give you *all* the ones fitting these criteria.  But you just needed one.  Maybe you'd find it in the first 50,000 rows and not need to search the other 14.95 million!  A loop definitely has the potential to be faster in such a case.\n",

For example, you might want to find those days when the price of a stock was significantly more or less than it was on the two adjacent days (one before and one after).  Although it's possible to do this without a loop, the code is a harder to write and to read, as you can see in the example below.  With a loop, it's not as fast, but it's clearer.  So if speed isn't an issue, use the loop.\n",

    "Now the entire rest of my script or noteboook will operate on only this tiny DataFrame.  (Obviously, you'd want to choose a number larger than three in your code!  I'm doing a tiny example here.  You might reduce 100,000 rows to just 1,000, for example.)\n",

It can work on just 1,000 and run 100x faster.  When your analysis code works and you're ready to write your report, delete the code that creates a small sample of the data and re-run your notebook from the start, now opearting on the whole dataset.  It will be slower, but you have to sit through that only once.\n",

I suggest adding a note in giant text at the end of your notebook saying something like, \"Don't forget, before you turn this in, USE THE WHOLE DATASET!\"  Then you'll remember to do that key step before you complete the project.\n",

    "**If the dataset is truly huge,** so large that it can't be stored in your computer's memory all at once, then trying to load it will either generate out-of-memory errors or it will slow the process down enormously while the computer tries to use its hard drive as temporary extra memory storage.  In such cases, don't forget the tip at the end of [this DataCamp chapter](big-cheat-sheet#chapter-1-using-iterators-in-pythonland) about the `chunksize` parameter.  It lets you process large files in smaller chunks."
