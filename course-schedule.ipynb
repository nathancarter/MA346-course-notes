Include at least 1000 in your sample, to get a sufficient representation of the full dataset.

(There are other values that column may take on, but we will analyze just those two.)\n",

    "    * The `action_taken` column contains only 1s and 3s.  This is because this dataset was filtered to include only accepted or rejected mortgages (no withdrawals, pre-approvals, etc.).  Replace this column with another boolean column, still using 0/1 for False/True, meaning \"application accepted.\"\n",
