    "## What is data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"data science\" was coined in 2001, attempting to describe a new field.  Some argue that it's nothing more than the natural evolution of statistics, and shouldn't be called a new field at all.  But others argue that it's more interdisciplinary.  For example, in *The Data Science Design Manual* (2017), Steven Skiena says the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I think of data science as lying at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and substantive application domains. From computer science comes machine learning and high-performance computing technologies for dealing with scale. From statistics comes a long tradition of exploratory data analysis, significance testing, and visualization. From application domains in business and the sciences comes challenges worthy of battle, and evaluation standards to assess when they have been adequately conquered.\n",
    "\n",
    "This echoes a famous blog post by Drew Conway in 2013, called [The Data Science Venn Diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram), in which he drew the following diagram to indicate the various fields that come together to form what we call \"data science.\"\n",

    "Regardless of whether data science is just a part of statistics, and regardless of the domain to which we're applying data science, the goal is the same: **to turn data into actionable value.**  The professional society INFORMS defines the related field of analytics as \"the scientific process of transforming data into insight for making better decisions.\""

    "## What's in our course?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our course covers the following four foundational aspects of data science.\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Mathematics:** We will cover foundational mathematical concepts, such as functions, relations, assumptions, conclusions, and abstraction, so that we can use these concepts to define and understand many aspects of data manipulation.  We will also make use of statistics from GB213 (and optionally other statistics courses you may have taken) in course projects, and we will briefly review this material as well.  We will also see small previews of other mathematics and statistics courses and their connections to data science, including graphs for social network analysis, matrices for finding themes in relations, and supervised machine learning.\n",
    " * **Technology:** We will extend your Python knowledge from CS230 with more advanced table manipulation functions, extended practice with data cleaning and manipulation tasks, computational notebooks (such as Jupyter), and GitHub for version control and project publishing.\n",
    " * **Visualization:** We will learn new types of plots for a wide variety of data types and what you intend to communicate about them.  We will also study the general principles that govern when and how to use visualizations and will learn how to build and publish interactive online visualizations (dashboards).\n",
    " * **Communication:** We will study how to write comments in code, documentation for code, motivations in computational notebooks, interpretation of results in computational notebooks, and technical reports about the results of analyses.  We will prioritize clarity, brevity, and knowing the target audience.  Many of these same principles will arise when creating presentations or videos as well.  Each of these modes of communication is required at some point in our course.\n",
    " \n",
    "Details about specific topics and their order appears in the course syllabus, and is summarized on [the main page of these course notes](intro)."

    "This course is an introduction to data science.  Learning more math, stats, and technology will make you more qualified than just this one course can.  (Bentley University has both a [Data Analytics major](https://www.bentley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/data-analytics) and a [Data Technologies minor](https://catalog.bentley.edu/undergraduate/programs/minors-arts-sciences/minor-in-data-technologies/?_ga=2.60446893.187969798.1590419787-1233038147.1564259120), if you're curious which courses are relevant.)\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are two focuses of our course that will make a big difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning on your own (LOYO)\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Big Picture\n",
    "---\n",
    "class: alert alert-primary\n",
    "---\n",
    "I once heard a director of informatics in the health care industry describe how quickly the field of data science changes by saying, \"There aren't any experts; it's just who's the fastest learner.\"  For that reason, it's essential to cultivate the skill of being able to learn new tools and concepts on your own.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus our course requires you to do so.  Twice during the course you must partner up with some classmates to research a topic outside of class (from an extensive list the instructor will provide) and report on it to the class, through writing, presenting, video, or whatever modality makes sense for the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in a career in this space, I encourage you to follow data scientists on platforms like Twitter and Medium so that you're kept abreast of the newest innovations and can learn those that are relevant to your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Excellent communication\n",
    "\n",
    "This was already mentioned earlier, but I will re-emphasize it here, because of how important it is.  In a meeting between the Bentley University Career Services office and about a dozen employers of our graduates, the employers were asked whether they preferred technical knowledge or what some call \"soft skills\" and others call \"power skills,\" which include communication perhaps first and foremost.  Unanimously every employer chose the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Big Picture\n",
    "---\n",
    "class: alert alert-primary\n",
    "---\n",
    "Data science is about turning data into actionable knowledge.  If a data scientist cannot take the results of their analysis and effectively communicate them to decision makers, they have not turned data into actionable knowledge, and have therefore failed at their goal.  Even if the insights are brilliant, if they are never shared with those who need them, they achieve nothing.  Good communication is essential for data work.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently our course will contain several opportunities for you to exercise your communication skills and receive feedback from the instructor on doing so.  See the comments under the \"communication\" bullet above, and the course outline on [the main page](intro).  The first such opportunities appear immediately below.\n"

    "On Windows, the file explorer is called Windoows Explorer; on Mac, it is called Finder.  It is essential that every computer-literate person knows how to use these tools.  Most of the actions you can take with your mouse in Windows Explorer or OS X Finder can also be taken using commands at a command prompt.  On Windows, this prompt can be found by running command.exe; on Mac, it can be found in Terminal.app.  It is very useful to know how to do at least basic file manipulation tools with the command prompt, because it enables you to take such action in cloud computing evironments where a file explorer is not always available.\n",
    "```\n",
