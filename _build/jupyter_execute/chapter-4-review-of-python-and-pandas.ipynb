    "This first set of exercises works with a database from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The dataset recorded all mortgage applications in the U.S. in 2018, over 15,000,000 of them.  Here we will work with a sample of about 0.1% of that data, just over 15,000 entries.  These 15,000 entries are randomly sampled from just those applications that were for a conventional loan for a typical home purchase of a principal residence (i.e., not a rental property, not an office building, etc., just standard house or condo for an individual or family).\n",

    " 8. Make your notebook presentable, using appropriate Markdown comments between cells to explain your code.  (Chapter 5 will cover best practices for how to write such comments, but do what you think is best for now.)\n",
