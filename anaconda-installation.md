# Anaconda Installation

Anaconda is a tool that installs Python together with the `conda` package
manager and several related apps, tools, and packages.  It's one of the
easiest ways to get Python installed on your system and ready to use for
data work.

These instructions are written primarily for Windows, with Mac
instructions in parentheses.

## Visit the Anaconda website

It is at this URL:
[www.anaconda.com/distribution](http://www.anaconda.com/distribution)

It looks like this:

## Choose your OS

Scroll down on that same website and click the Windows link to indicate
that you want to download the installer for Windows.

(Mac users obviously click the macOS link instead.)

## Download the Installer

Click the download button for the Python 3.7 distribution of Anaconda,
as shown on the left below.

website download page, Python 3.7 and Python 2.7, with the Python 3.7
version highlighted" src="../../_images/install-image-3.png" class="center-box-image"/>


## Run the Installer

Run the installer once it's downloaded, probably by clicking the
downloaded file in your browser's list of downloaded files, usually at
the bottom left of the window.

(For Mac users, this will be a .pkg file instead of an .exe.)

Accept all the default choices during installation. This may take up to
10 minutes.

(For Mac users, the installer will look slightly different than the one
above.)

After this, you may wish to [install VS Code](vs-code-installation) as well.
